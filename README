WIND: A simple way to think
===========================

Wind is a blog engine.
And it's simple, realy simple.

HTML 5 is pretty, and Wind was developed with this!
Done for the future! Until 2012, at least.

Why simple? Becouse you don't need a lot of stuffs just to write.
Or do you think that Bible was written with a powerfull word processor?
Powerfull inspiration, ok, but with simple tools.

1 - How it works?
=================

Download the source code and install the required gems:

    sudo gem install sinatra
    sudo gem install sinatra-flash
    sudo gem install RedCloth

Ok, now is just run the server:

    ruby app.rb

Open your favorite browser, access:

    http://localhost:4567

Ok... login, think and write!
The default code to login is "admin".

2 - Config
==========

All (few) configurations can be made in config.rb file.
